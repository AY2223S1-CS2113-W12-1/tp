## Product Overview

easySEP is a CLI application created to assist NUS Computer Engineering (CEG) undergraduates intending to embark on a Student Exchange Programme (SEP) in their planning for student exchange.
In particular, it is a useful utility for exploring potential module mappings for various partner universities, creating and maintaining lists for them and also favouriting selected ones for easier reference. As an added feature, users can also curate their timetables to prevent potential clashes in lessons.

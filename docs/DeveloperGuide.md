## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Database
The database reads in SEP module data from data.csv and stores the useful data into an ArrayList of module mappings and universities.

Upon starting easySEP, the DatabaseStorage will load each line from data.csv, parse the line using DatabaseParser, and store the data into the Database.

Relevant exceptions are thrown when there are unexpected scenarios. For instance, if data.csv cannot be found at the given file path, a FileNotFoundException is thrown.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the three main database classes - DatabaseStorage, DatabaseParser, and Database.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of the program, from the initial loadDatabase call to the eventual completion of updating the entire database.

### Timetable
Upon starting easySEP, a TimetableManager is created in preparation for users to begin adding Timetables. The TimetableManager is used to create new Timetables, manage existing Timetables and delete old Timetables. 
These Timetables are stored in a HashMap and indexed by university name to facilitate easy reference.

For existing Timetables, they can be used to add and delete Lessons. Each Timetable is made up of a HashMap of ArrayLists(type: Lesson) indexed by weekday e.g. Monday for easy compartmentalisation.
Within Timetables, Lessons will compromise details like the day, start time and end time. The ArrayLists(type: Lesson) are sorted in non-descending order by the start time of the Lessons.

Relevant exceptions are thrown when unanticipated scenarios occur. For instance, if the user attempts to delete a non-existent Timetable, a TimetableNotFoundException is thrown.
Another example is the user attempting to add a lesson that is conflicting with an existing lesson in his/her timetable. In this case, a TimetableClashException is thrown.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the three main timetable classes - TimetableManager, Timetable and Lesson.

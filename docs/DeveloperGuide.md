## Acknowledgements

{list here sources of all reused/adapted ideas, code, documentation, and third-party libraries -- include links to the original source as well}

## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Database
The database reads in SEP module data from data.csv and stores the useful data into an ArrayList of module mappings and universities.

Upon starting easySEP, the DatabaseStorage will load each line from data.csv, parse the line using DatabaseParser, and store the data into the Database.

Relevant exceptions are thrown when there are unexpected scenarios. For instance, if data.csv cannot be found at the given file path, a FileNotFoundException is thrown.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the three main database classes - DatabaseStorage, DatabaseParser, and Database.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of the program, from the initial loadDatabase call to the eventual completion of updating the entire database.
